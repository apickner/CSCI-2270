I've created a Python GUI. Basically, I built this as a simple interface based on the
CLI program I created. It works the same in that I compile the C++ and run it through
python. This was fun because I could learn about the Python library that deals with
subprocess. Also, this is my first GUI ever in Python, so I wanted to keep it as simple
as possible.

You should see a c++ folder here as well...
To get up and running, just run:

    python TkinterCustom.py
