I've created a Python script that handles all of the user input, and I am working
on getting to a basic GUI soon. Basically, I built the Python script to go out and
get my twitter data, and then I used C++ to create the graph and generate the text.

All of the files should be in the same directory.
To get up and running, just run:

    python TwitterMarkovChainGenerator.py

This will take you to my program. Enter a valid file location, a valid twitter handle,
and the max # of tweets you want collected. My program should prompt the user for
valid input if the input is not actually valid. From there (within Python), I compile the C++, and
enter a loop that executes my C++.
